# Calculator

I wrote this really shitty calculator back when I was a kid in Python. Now that I'm starting uni, I decided to come back to this.

I haven't written Python code in years, so forgive me for any bad practices.


## How to run this
Make sure Python 3 is installed on your device. Run the following command:
```bash
python3 ./calculator.py # python3 or python if it doesn't work
```
Or better (for Linux users):
```bash
chmod +x ./calculator.py # run this only for the first time
./calculator.py
```

Or you could just alternatively do `import calculator` (kidding, you can't).
